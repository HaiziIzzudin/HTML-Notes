<ol><li>Explain the three core principles of Information Security and why they are important.
<p>
The three main principles of information security are **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **availability**. Confidentiality means keeping data secret from unauthorized users. Integrity is making sure the data is correct and not changed by accident or on purpose. Availability ensures that the data and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users.

These principles are important because they help protect sensitive information from hackers, mistakes, or system failures. If one of these principles fails, it could cause loss of trust, legal problems, or harm to people and businesses. That is why every security system is designed with these three ideas in mind.

</p>


<li>Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
<p>
The **CISO** is a high-level officer responsible for creating and maintaining the organization’s information security strategy. This includes setting the direction of security policies and making sure they align with the company’s goals. The CISO may report to the CEO, COO, or CIO, depending on the organization’s structure.

A CISO must also ensure that risks are properly managed and that all departments follow the right security measures. They lead the security team and work closely with other departments to keep information secure. Their leadership helps reduce cyber threats and ensures the company complies with legal standards.

<li>Discuss how people can be a challenge to information security.
<p>
People can be a big challenge because they sometimes make mistakes or ignore security rules. For example, someone might click on a phishing link, use a weak password, or share confidential data by accident. These actions can open the door for cyber attacks and data breaches.

Another problem is insider threats—employees who misuse their access on purpose. They might steal company data or damage systems. To reduce these risks, companies must train their workers, build awareness, and monitor user activity carefully.

</p>


<li>Define vulnerability and give an example of how it can lead to a threat.
<p>
A **vulnerability** is a weakness in a system that could be used by an attacker to gain access or cause harm. This could be a software bug, poor configuration, or even untrained staff. If a hacker finds a vulnerability, they might use it to steal data, shut down systems, or spread malware.

For example, if a company forgets to update their software, a known bug might let a hacker break in. That means the vulnerability became a threat because it was not fixed in time. Managing vulnerabilities through updates and scans helps reduce risk.

</p>


<li>Explain the importance of an information security policy in an organization.
<p>
An information security **policy** is a written document that tells employees what they should and should not do to protect company data. It acts like a set of rules that helps reduce mistakes, prevent abuse, and provide direction during security incidents. Policies cover areas like password rules, email use, and access control.

Having a clear policy is important because it sets expectations for everyone. It also protects the company legally if someone breaks the rules. A good policy should be easy to understand, updated regularly, and signed by all staff.

</p>


<li>Compare and contrast a hot site and a cold site in disaster recovery planning.
<p>
A **hot site** is a backup location that is fully equipped with hardware, software, and network connections. It can be used almost immediately if the main office goes down. A **cold site**, on the other hand, is just a space with no equipment—it takes time to set up and start working.

Hot sites are faster to use but more expensive to maintain. Cold sites are cheaper but slower during an emergency. Choosing between them depends on the company’s budget and how fast it needs to recover after a disaster.

</p>


<li>What is a hybrid security framework and why do organizations use it?
<p>
A **hybrid security framework** combines two or more existing security standards like ISO, NIST, COBIT, or CIS. Instead of creating a new system from scratch, an organization can take the best parts of each model to suit its own needs. This saves time and ensures that important security areas are covered.

Organizations use hybrid frameworks because they give flexibility. They can meet both local and international rules, make audits easier, and improve teamwork across departments. It is a balanced way to create a strong, custom-fit security program.

</p>


<li>Describe how intrusion detection systems (IDS) work and their importance.
<p>
An **intrusion detection system** watches network traffic or computers to find unusual activity that could be a cyber attack. It can be **host-based**, where it's installed on a single device, or **network-based**, where it checks all traffic in and out of the network. IDS tools compare behavior to known attack patterns.

These systems are important because they help detect attacks early. When a threat is found, alerts are sent so the team can act quickly. Even if they cannot stop every attack, IDS tools reduce damage by giving early warning signs.

</p>


<li>Explain the role of education, training, and awareness (SETA) in information security.
<p>
SETA stands for **Security Education, Training, and Awareness**. It is a program designed to teach employees how to protect information. Education is about deep knowledge, training is hands-on learning, and awareness reminds people to follow rules daily.

The SETA program helps reduce accidents caused by human error, like clicking on phishing links or using weak passwords. It also builds a security-minded culture. Companies with strong SETA programs are more likely to detect and stop attacks before damage is done.

</p>


<li>Why is policy management considered a living process in information security?
<p>
Policy management is **not a one-time activity**. It must grow and change as the company changes. As new threats appear and technology advances, policies must be updated to stay effective. This is why we call it a “living” process.

There must be a clear schedule to review and revise policies—usually every year or when something major happens. A policy administrator is responsible for managing changes, keeping records, and making sure employees stay informed and follow the rules.

</p>


<li>Discuss the differences between civil and criminal law in information security.
<p>
**Civil law** handles disputes between people or companies, often involving compensation for harm or loss. In cybersecurity, this could involve suing someone for leaking private data or damaging systems. Civil law needs proof “on balance of probability.”

**Criminal law**, on the other hand, is about offenses that affect society, like hacking or data theft. These are handled by the government and require stronger proof “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Punishment may include jail time, fines, or both.

</p>


<li>What is the importance of risk assessment in information security?
<p>
**Risk assessment** helps organizations understand which systems and data are at risk and how serious the threat is. It includes identifying assets, vulnerabilities, and possible attacks. This step helps decide what security controls are needed.

By doing a risk assessment, a company can focus on the most important risks and avoid wasting money on low-risk problems. It also helps with legal compliance and planning for disaster recovery or business continuity.

    <td>4 Priciples of Metadata:</td>
    <td><strong>1. Modularity</strong><ul dir="auto"><li>Characterized by  <em><strong>diverse sources of content, styles of content management, and approaches to resource description</strong></em>. </li><li>Allows designers of metadata schemas to <em><strong>create new assemblies based on established metadata schemas</strong></em> and benefit from observed best practice. </li><li>Data elements from different schemas, vocabularies and other building blocks can be combined in a <em><strong>syntactically and semantically interoperable way</strong></em>.</li></ul><strong>2. Extensibility</strong><ul dir="auto"><li>Must allow for <em><strong>extensions</strong></em> so that particular needs of a given application can be accommodated. </li><li>Some metadata elements are <em><strong>likely to be found in most metadata schemas, while others will be specific to particular applications or domains</strong></em>.</li><li>Must <em><strong>easily accommodate the notion of a base schema</strong></em> with additional elements that tailor a given application to local needs or domain-specific needs without  compromising the interoperability provided by the base schema.</li></ul><strong>3. Refinement</strong><ul dir="auto"><li>metadata standards should allow schema designers to <em><strong>choose a level of detail</strong></em> appropriate to a given application.</li><li>2 notions of refinement to consider:<ol dir="auto"><li>Addition of qualifiers that <em><strong>refine</strong></em> the meaning of an element. E.g.: <em>Illustrator, author, composer, or sculptor</em> are all particular types of general term <em>creator</em>.</li><li><em><strong>Specification</strong></em> of particular schemes or value sets that define the range of values for a given element. This way, semantic interoperability across applications can be increased by relying on a common value set.</li></ol></li></ul><strong>4. Multilingualism</strong><ul dir="auto"><li>The Web affords unprecedented access to resources.</li><li>Complementary processes of <em><strong>internationalization</strong></em> and <em><strong>localization</strong></em>.</li><li>These two processes can sometimes work at cross-purposes. While global resource discovery is best served by internationalization, the needs of any given community may be better served by supporting local conventions.</li></ul></td>

    <td>9 Practicalities of Metadata:</td>
    <td><ol dir="auto"><li><strong>Application Profile</strong><br>Assemblage of metadata elements selected from one or more metadata schemas and combined in a compound schema.</li><li><strong>Syntax and Semantics</strong><br>Semantics is about meaning; syntax is about form.</li><li><strong>Association Models</strong><br><em>Embedded metadata</em> resides within the markup of the resource. <em>Associated metadata</em> is maintained in files tightly coupled to the resources they describe. <em>Third-Party metadata</em> is maintained in a separate repository by an organization.</li><li><strong>Identifying and Naming Metadata Elements</strong><br>Particular tools and applications can use different presentation labels within their systems to make the labels more understandable and useful in a given linguistic, cultural, or domain context.</li><li><strong>Metadata Registries</strong><br>...provide the means to identify and refer to established schemas and application profiles, potentially including the means for machine mapping among different schemas.</li><li><strong>Completeness of Description</strong><br>...will be determined by policies and best practices designated by the agency creating the metadata, and those policies and practices will be guided by the functional requirements of services or applications. </li><li><strong>Mandatory Versus Optional Elements</strong><br>An element that is essential in one domain may not even be sensible in another, hence few, if any, elements in a general metadata set should be thought of as mandatory. </li><li><strong>Subjective and Objective Metadata</strong><br><em>Objective metadata</em> can be machine generated in most instances, while <em>Subjective metadata</em> are specifically intended to represent a subjective evaluation.</li><li><strong>Automated Generation of Metadata</strong><br>...that can be automated to some degree, and which can be expected to grow in importance as advances in such areas as natural language processing, data mining, profile and pattern recognition algorithms become more effective.</li></ol></td>
